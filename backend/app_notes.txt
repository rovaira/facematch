- App Functionalities -

See an image and a name associated w/ that image
Name disappears (timer mechanism?)
User is to select the correct name from a list that matches with an image
Every correctly matched image-name gets added to a "Complete" list
Any wrong matches gets cycled through again until the image is correctly matched

- User Stories -

# index
As a user
I should see a list of all the cards in my stack
So I can see which image/name pairs I will be trying to remember

# show
As a user
I should see an image and a name that corresponds with that image
So that I can try to memorize that image-name pair

As a user
I see that the name for a particular image disappears
So I can select the correct name that matches that image from a list

As a user
If I correctly match a name to an image, my completed counter increases by one
So the app keeps track of all my completed matches

# new
As a user
I want to add a new card to my stack
So I can include another person I'd like practice memorizing their image/name

# edit
As a user
I want to edit a card's image/name
So I can practice matching a face/name with another picture of that person

- Schema Structure -

Cards
- "image", string, null: false
- "name", string, null: false
- "correctly_matched", boolean, default: false, null: false
- timestamps

- Future Functionalities -

* User accounts so you can:

1) upload your own pics and organize them into decks
-- immediate family
-- extended family
-- college friends

2) save progress reports for each deck
-- how many correct?
-- which cards are easier/more difficult to remember?
-- might need to add a another model to keep track of this info
for example, within a round, which cards were correctly matched?
how many times has a card been played --> what was the match ratio?

* Mobile ready

1) it should definitely be something you can play on your phone/tablet
